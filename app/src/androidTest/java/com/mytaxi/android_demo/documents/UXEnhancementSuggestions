1. It would be good to provide forgot password functionality on the login page

2. It would be good to provide context based error messages
    Username entered , Password not entered (message "Please enter the password")
    Username not entered , Password entered (message "Please enter the username")
    Username not entered , Password not entered (message "Username or Password cannot be blank")
    Valid Username , Invalid Password (message "Incorrect Username or Password")
    Invalid Username , Valid Password (message "Incorrect Username or Password")

3. It would be good to have reset button to clear field's text

4. It would be good to have checkbox with label "remember password" in the login page

5. It would be good to provide password mandate to accept password which has 1 number , 1 special character while registration

6. It would be good to have lower bound limit on length of password(6 or more characters)

7. It would be good if call button calls the driver instead of opening the dial pad with driver's number, so that when call ends user can land on the app.

8. It would be good to have a sign up functionality for unregistered users on login page

9. In driver profile page , its not easy to identify what details are provided.
   Assuming those are address and joining date of driver, It would be good to provide text that explains what details are these.
